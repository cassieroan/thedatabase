## Part 2

This part does not require coding. Explain some potential problems you might face working with the tables as they are described above. What strategies would you use to manage these issues?

Please read the tables carefully, and answer this question from the greatest scope of perspectives you can. This question is meant both to test your knowledge of relational databases, and your approach to broad ambiguous problems. It is recommended you not answer this question without researching.

# RESPONSE:

1. Data Integrity: Ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and valid is crucial. In the given tables, there are no explicit constraints mentioned. One strategy to manage this is to enforce primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and appropriate data types to maintain data integrity. For example, adding primary keys to the patterns and hashes tables, and ensuring that the block column in the hashes table references a valid block in another table (if applicable).

2. Performance: As the data volume increases, queries might become slow, especially when dealing with substring searches (LIKE '%' || p.pattern || '%'). Indexing columns used in join conditions and where clauses, such as pattern in the patterns table and block in the hashes table, can improve query performance. Additionally, optimizing queries and database schema design can help alleviate performance issues.

3. Scalability: The tables provided might not be scalable for large datasets. As the number of rows in the tables increases, managing indexing, optimizing queries, and scaling hardware resources become more critical. Partitioning large tables, vertical or horizontal sharding, and employing distributed database systems are strategies to address scalability concerns.

4. Pattern Matching: The current approach to pattern matching using substring searches might not be efficient, especially for large datasets. Depending on the specific use case, alternative approaches such as using full-text search engines like Elasticsearch or implementing custom indexing and search mechanisms might be more suitable.

5. Data Security: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or modification is crucial. Implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms, as well as regularly auditing database access and activities, can enhance data security.
